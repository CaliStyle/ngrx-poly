NgRx Poly is a set of utilities for reducing boilerplate when working with NgRx. Everything is created with factories and generics, reducing thousands of lines of action, effect, and reducer code. Best of all, it's extendable - you can add your own actions, effects, and reducer calls just like you'd expect to be able to.
